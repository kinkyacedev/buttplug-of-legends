# buttplug-of-legends
Script that interacts with League of Legends and https://buttplug.io

### This project may break at any time and it's not very tested. It's mostly a proof of concept. Use at your own risk, and only with consenting adults.
#### I tested it with a Lovense Hush in summer 2020, and it should support at least vibrators with one motor (until League breaks something). I may rework this project in the future when I have some spare time.
#### Issues and contributions are appreciated, but code will significantly change, and hoping to get a way cleaner code.
